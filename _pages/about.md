Hi :), welcome to my homepage.

I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer engineering  department in [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). My research is supervised by [Professor Huaiyu Dai](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/hdai/) and [Dr. Ismail Guvenc](https://sites.google.com/site/iguvenc/). My research interst is mainly developing mathematically tractable models of cellular networks using the tools of optimization, machine learning and game theory. Recently, I bacame intrested in robustness/security of deep image classifiers. In summer 2019, I was an intern in [Docomo Innovations](https://www.docomoinnovations.com/) where I  explored the dimension reduction  for wireless channels using tSNE, UMAP, PCA, and Autoencoder algorithms.
