Hi :), welcome to my homepage.

I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical  engineering from  [Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](https://en.um.ac.ir/), Mashhad, Iran in 2012. I finished my M.Sc. in [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), Tehran, Iran in 2014. I completed my PhD  in Electrical and Computer engineering  department in [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). My research is supervised by [Prof. Huaiyu Dai](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/hdai/) and [Prof. Ismail Guvenc](https://sites.google.com/site/iguvenc/). My research interest is mainly developing mathematically tractable models of cellular networks using the tools of optimization, machine learning and game theory. Recently, I bacame intrested in robustness/security of deep image classifiers. In summer 2019, I was an intern in [Docomo Innovations, Inc.](https://www.docomoinnovations.com/).  In summer 2020, I joined [Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.](https://www.qualcomm.com/)  Corporate Research & Development (CRD) as a summer intern.



## Research Interests

- Robustness of deep neural networks 
- Black-box optimization and Bayesian Optimization
- Wireless communication and UAV Networks
- Convex optimization and game theory
