Taking advantage of the inherent mobility feature of the
UAVs an adaptive interference avoidance scheme is developed.
Using the proposed scheme, the UAVs can effectively
reconfigure their positions to avoid the interference and
improve the data flow from the source(s) to the destination(s).
The weighted Cheeger constant for 3D scenarios is
introduced as an effective metric to improve the UAVs
network connectivity. This work got accepted to INFOCOM 2019, and the full paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8737472).

Simple demos of the proposed trajectory design are shown in the following animated figures. In the figures for trajectory of the UAVs, the circles show the final locations of the UAVs, while the beginning of the lines show the initial locations of the UAV relays.
